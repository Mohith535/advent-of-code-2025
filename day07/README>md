**Puzzle:** Laboratories

This folder contains my solutions for **Day 7** of Advent of Code 2025.

## Problem Summary

A **tachyon beam** enters a laboratory grid from a starting point `S` and travels **downward**.

- Empty space (`.`): beam passes through
- Splitter (`^`):
  - Stops the incoming beam
  - Emits two new beams:
    - One to the **left**
    - One to the **right**
- All beams always continue **downward**

---

## Part 1 — Beam Splitting Count

Track all tachyon beams until they:
- Reach another splitter, or
- Exit the grid

Each time a splitter creates **new beams**, it counts as a **split**.

**Goal:**  
Count how many total beam splits occur.

## Part 2 — Quantum Tachyon Manifold

Instead of many beams, **a single tachyon particle** exists.

At each splitter:
- The universe splits into **two timelines**
- One timeline goes left
- One timeline goes right

All timelines continue independently.

**Goal:**  
Calculate the **total number of timelines** after the particle finishes all possible paths.
